### Toy problem description

There is no fun in modeling without purpose, which is why we'll introduce the package with a simple problem.

Our recently sprouted pepper seedlings are growing on the windowsill indoors. We just watered them, and we'd like to know how the water content of the soil changes through time so we can water them again at the optimal moment: the soil should have dried adequately to promote root growth without putting the seedlings under too much drought stress.

## Creating the model üõ†
"""

# ‚ïî‚ïê‚ï° 6ef5c63a-b753-43ae-baee-f6c24313a385
md"""
As the name suggests, one of the most important goals of PlantModules is to enable the user to easily model plant growth in a _modular_ manner. In order to achieve this, we will define our plant in function of a few sets of similarly behaving parts or "modules" for short. Parts of the same module can be similar on the structural - and on the functional level.

On the structural level, some examples are:
- An oak tree can be considered a repeating module in a forest.
- A branch can be considered a repeating module in a tree.
- A collenchyma cell can be considered a repeating module in a branch.

On the functional level, on the other hand:
- Most structural modules of a tree (branches, leaves, root segments, etc.) contain water which will flow between them as dictated by hydraulic laws, which plays an important role in plant growth. All these structural modules share this same functional module. 
- One or more of the plant's structural modules will assimilate carbon through photosynthesis, while the others do not. On the cellular level, only cells containing chloroplasts should share this functional module.

As such, the workflow to create a model in PlantModules boils down to defining these modules and how they interact. Let's jump right in!

#### The plant

The first step in modeling our plant's growth is defining its structure. There are a lot of options for formalizing the structure of a plant, and perhaps the most obvious first choice we need to make is what spatial scale to model on. PlantModules allows for a lot of freedom here, including the option to combine multiple spatial scales. 
For the first tutorial, we'll consider a very simple example: an organ-scale plant model of a plant with two leaves, a stem and a root system.
"""

# ‚ïî‚ïê‚ï° 659e911c-8af2-4a66-855a-e333c41120c1
md"""
PlantModules uses **graphs** to define the relationships between modules. As such, structural modules need to be implemented as graph nodes of some sort. We'll be using the graph implementation from [the PlantGraphs](https://virtualplantlab.com/stable/manual/Graphs/) package for this tutorial, though [any graph implementation can be used](nothinghere).

#### The environment

Plants need an environment to grow in. For most plants, the most basic environmental compartments that need defining are the soil, from which the plant gets water and nutrients, and the air, with which the plant exchanges gasses and to which it loses water. 

For more intricate models one may for example also want to take into account the sun as well as possible sources of shadow or divide the soil into multiple compartments, but we will stick to the basics for now.

### Defining the functional modules

Now that we have an idea of the plant's structural modules, we need to define some sort of functionality expressed by one or more of them. Some examples, such as only a select set of structural modules doing photosynthesis, have been mentioned before. In this tutorial, we'll mostly neglect carbon dynamics and instead focus on the plant's water dynamics.

md"""
PlantModules defines functional modules as as sets of differential equations implemented in [ModelingToolkit](https://docs.sciml.ai/ModelingToolkit/stable/).
There are three functional modules already provided by PlantModules:

- `PlantModules.hydraulic_module`, which describes the hydraulics-driven growth of a compartment.
- `PlantModules.environmental_module`, which describes a compartment that is subject to hydraulic laws but does therefor not change in size.
- `PlantModules.constant_carbon_module`, which describes a compartment with a constant amount of carbon.

# ‚ïî‚ïê‚ï° 2ca2f739-2b61-4519-bdc4-d3081c793446
md"""
While these pre-implemented modules already define most of the functional process, they both lack an equation for one of the variables that they still expect to be defined by the user.
The former module, which we will use to simulate the three structural plant modules, requires a specification for the carbon content (in mol / m^3).
The latter module, which we will use to simulate the soil and air, still expects a specification of the water potential (in MPa).

We can provide this missing information as either a constant value or a function of the variables and parameters defined in that functional module. We'll define them here and connect them to their function modules right after.

Next to the equations themselves, an important part in describing the plant's functional processes is defining the equations' parameter - and initial values. Since we'll restrict ourselves to hydraulic equations for this tutorial, these parameters and variables are the ones described in the section [Theoretical overview](nothinghere).

In PlantModules, parameter - and initial values are defined in a hierarchical manner, here listed in ascending priority:

> **Model-wide default values < module-specific default values < node-specific values**

For our current example, this means that there is no point in specifying the initial values for the compartment dimensions *D* for our Leaf compartments in the module-specific default values or the model-wide default values, since we already defined these values in all of the Leaf nodes of the graph, which have the highest priority.

#### Structural connections

As mentioned near the beginning, PlantModules uses graphs to define relationships between modules, and the structural modules were implemented as graph node types. All we need to do now is create a graph using these node types reflecting the desired structure of our plant.

Since we're using the PlantGraphs Julia package for this tutorial, we can easily define simple graphs using the DSL:
"""

# ‚ïî‚ïê‚ï° 9af27c17-8f21-4f22-a5bb-e9c95cfdf2f9

# ‚ïî‚ïê‚ï° ecb23f1e-ee39-4c5a-911f-eaa252c23968

We can inspect the structure of our plant by visualising the graph:
"""

# ‚ïî‚ïê‚ï° 86d81fa3-bea4-40fa-9522-7db9fe2f6a82
draw(plant_graph, resolution = (500, 400))

# ‚ïî‚ïê‚ï° c36668fa-3046-4967-a616-841a048ea7f9
md"""
There are some structural modules missing here: the environmental ones. We could have added the soil compartment in the graph we just defined, but not the air. That is because both leaves are connected to this same air node, which would introduce a cycle into our graph, something many plant-related graph implementations do not support.

To overcome this, PlantModules allows the user to input multiple graphs and the ability to define what structural modules should be fully connected between all input graphs to acquire the final structural graph:

If we consider functional modules as the information stored in the nodes of the graph, then the functional connections are the information stored in the edges.
